- **Dates**: DD/MM/YYYY format
- **Grades**: Numeric values with pass/fail threshold at 65

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Adaptive chart positioning
- Flexible grid systems

## Development Notes

- **Mock Data**: Currently uses 28 sample students with realistic data
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Students sorted by first name, then last name
- **Auto-generated IDs**: New students receive sequential 9-digit IDs
- **Empty Filter Logic**: Empty filters show all data (no restrictions)
